      <p class="about">My name is Thanarat (Terry) Phuvapaisalkij. I was born in Thailand in 1989 and lived in Bangkok until I was 10 years old. I moved to the united states in 1999 and settled down in Denver, Colorado.

I started dancing in college when I met my crew member, Yuta. Together we started the breaking crew Amida. I have been dancing for 8 years. There are currently 4 original members of the crew.

I am currently working as a Denver Police Officer and I have been on the force for about 1 year.

I plan on opening up my own store sometime in the future.</p>
